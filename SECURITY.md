## Version Labels

Version labels are broke down into 3 components, Major, Minor & Patch.
The first number represents major releases, the second is minor and the third represents patches.

**Major Releases:** Indicates a significant change which may cause existing projects to become incompatible with the new
version. You should take care when upgrading an existing project to a new major release as it may require major
alterations to your existing project related code.

**Minor Releases:** Indicates that new features have been added, removed, deprecated or modified in a way which will
cause existing project related code to be impacted by in a minor way.

**Patch Releases:** Indicates bug fixes, security patches or behind the scenes changes which should leave the user
unaffected. Sometimes these releases may include additional features that were supposed to already exist but had been
excluded from a previous release due to a known issue that hadn't been resolved yet. Although existing project related
code won't be impacted by these changes.

## Latest Version

The *latest version* is recommended for personal & educational projects. This will include the latest features, security
updates and bug fixes; however, it could be unstable. The latest version is released on a unscheduled basis.

## LTS Version

The *LTS version* is recommended for business projects. This will usually be 1 major release behind the latest version
and is always considered to be the most secure and stable version. When the LTS version falls behind the latest version
it will no-longer receive feature updates; however, security updates will still be released for the current LTS version.
