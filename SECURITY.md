## Version Labels

Version labels are broke down into 3 components, Major, Minor & Patch.
The first number represents major releases, the second is minor and the third represents patches.

**Major Releases:** Indicate a significant change which may cause existing projects to become incompatible with the new
version. You should take care when upgrading an existing project to a new major release as it may require alterations
to your existing source code.

**Minor Releases:** Indicates that new features have been added, removed, deprecated or modified in a way which the user
will be effected by.

**Patch Releases:** Usually indicate bug fixes or back end changes which should leave the user unaffected. Sometimes
this includes additional features that were supposed to already exist but had been excluded from a previous release due
to known issues that hadn't been resolved yet.

## Latest Version

The 'latest version' is recommended for personal & educational projects. This will include the latest features, security
updates and bug fixes. The latest version will be updated regularly and sometimes on a weekly basis.

## LTS Version

The 'LTS version' is recommended for business projects. This will usually be 1 major release behind the latest version
and is always considered to be the most secure and stable version. When the LTS version falls behind the latest version
it will no-longer receive feature updates; however, security updates will still be released for the current LTS version.
